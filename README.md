# Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains course materials for Object-Oriented Programming 2 at [Kasetsart University](http://www.ku.th), taught by James Brucker.

Information about the topics covered and requirements are in the [course description](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/wiki/About) in the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/wiki).

[Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/wiki) contains the [course description](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/wiki/About) and a [weekly schedule](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/wiki/Home) including topics, homework, and links to the lab and programming assignments.

[Source](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src/master) repository has lecture slides, assignments, and related material.     
    [week1](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src/master/week1) for week1 material,
    [week2](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src/master/week2) for week2 material,
    and so on

[Results & Feedback]( https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src/master/results): the [results](https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src/master/results) folder in the source repository contains results and feedback on programmand assignments and labs.

**Individual Feedback and Corrections**: TAs will use Bitbucket to comment on your labwork, and a Google Doc to record individual feedback and things for you to work on.  Check the Google Doc regularly, because you are responsible for implementing any corrections or rework that the TAs/instructor write in that doc. It counts toward your grade.

### Cloning the Course Repository

The Source repository and wiki have been updated many times, with a lot of material revised and deleted.  To clone the whole thing will waste lots of disk space and bandwidth (for downloading).  If you want to clone the course repo, just clone the most recent update by using the ``git clone --depth 1``, e.g.

    cmd> cd someplace
    cmd> git clone --depth 1 git@bitbucket.org:skeoop/oop.git
after that, you can update your clone anytime using ``git pull``.
