* Code Should be Easy to Read
  * Use whitespace for readability
  * Use the naming standard
  * Use consistent intentation and formatting
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* Comments where needed.  This includes all class and method Javadoc.
* Avoid magic numbers.
* One purpose for each variable
* Use good names
* No global variables
* Return results, don't print them
* Fail fast


These guidelines are similar to the style standard
in the MITx course [Software Construction in Java](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.005.1x+3T2016/),
