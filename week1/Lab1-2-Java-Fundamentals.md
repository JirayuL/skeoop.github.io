# Lab1: Fundamentals Practice

In this lab you will work on 3 things:

1. How to write equals and why it should be declared as `equals(Object other)	`.
2. Writing Javadoc in classes.
3. Using Git and Bitbucket.

## Files for this lab.

1. In your workspace directory create a project named `lab1`.
2. Go to https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src.  In the **week1** directory download lab1.zip.
3. Unzip the file into your `lab1` project.

## Exploring Equals

1. Run the Main class in the lab1 project.
2. equals does not behave the way it should. (discuss)
3. Look at the "fundamental methods" document (online) for the correct way to write equals and implement it.

## Writing Javadoc

1. Write good Javadoc in the Student class.
2. Fix the equals method in Student.

## About Git

Git is a version control system that we'll use throughout this course for
submitting work.  Git is widely used for managing project documents,
especially source code.  Every developer needs to be able to use Git
(and helpful to know Subversion, too).

In this course you'll use Bitbucket.org for your git repositories.

There are 3 ways to use Git:

* type commands on the command line. Its a good idea to do this first so you'll clearly understand the basics of Git.
* use a GUI tool such as SmartGit.
* use Git tool that is including with Eclipse, BlueJ, and other IDEs.

If you use Eclipse, using Eclipse's Git client is convenient, but it can be tricky (and error-prone) at first.  So use the git command line interface first. Once you understand it well, try Eclipse egit on a test project (something you can delete later!).

## Learning Git

1. https://try.github.io - interactive tutorial.
2. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials - many tutorials, including advanced topics. Uses Bitbucket in some examples (Bitbucket is owned by Atlassian).
3. Section 4 of the video course "Software Engineering", on se.cpe.ku.ac.th. Has a nice graphical explanation of how working copy, local repo, and remote interact.
