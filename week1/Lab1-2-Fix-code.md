## Lab1: Java Fundamentals Practice (fixcode)

|   |   |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
|Objective: |Practice writing common Java methods and good Javadoc.|


|What to Submit: |Create a Git repository named **fixcode**. Submit your Java code to this repo. Include a README.md and .gitignore.            |

In this lab you will do these things:

1. Fix some bad code in the "fixcode" project.
2. Write good Javadoc for classes and methods.
3. Write an "equals" method, and discover why it should always be declared as `equals(Object other)`.
4. Commit your code to git and upload (push).
5. Draw a UML class diagram of Person and Student.

## Files for this lab.

1. Go to https://bitbucket.org/skeoop/oop/src.  In the **week1** directory download lab1-fixcode.zip.
2. Unzip the file in your workspace.  It will create a directory named "fixcode".
3. Create an IDE (Eclipse) project using the source code.

## Exploring Equals

1. Run the Main class in the fixcode project.
2. equals does not behave the way it should. Can you explain why it fails in some cases?   Write your answer in README.md (in the fixcode project).
3. Look at the "fundamental methods" document (online) and correct the equals method.
4. Rewrite the equals method in the Person class to use the standard template for equals.
5. Write an equals method for the `Student` class that also uses the standard template. Two `Student` are equal if both the name and id are the same.

## Write Javadoc

Write good Javadoc in the Person and Student classes.  There are several Javadoc errors and omissions.
Put in your name as author in every class.

## Draw a UML Class diagram of Person and Student

## Upload your Code to Github

1. Use repo name `fixcode`.
