Exercises on classes and objects. 

## 1. Three fundamentals of OOP


________________ means that an object contains both data (state) and methods that operate on the data.

________________ allows one class to reuse all the behavior from another class. In can optionally redefine (override) some methods and add new methods.

________________ means many classes can implement the same method **and** we can invoke the method without knowing (or caring) that actual class of the object that performs it.  `toString` is an example -- we can invoke `toString` on any object reference without knowing what class will perform the method.


## 2. What are the classes and attributes in this problem?

A board game is played by 2 players on an 8x8 board.  Each player has a number of pieces on the board. Each player's pieces have different color (can be any color but not the same color). The players take turns moving a piece, like in chess.  There are three types of pieces: A, B, and C.  Each piece moves differently.  A pices can capture any piece (A, B, C), B and C can capture each other.

* What classes would you use to write code for this game?
* What are some attributes of the classes?
* What are some methods of the classes?
