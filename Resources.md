# Useful Resources for OOP

## Good Books

* *Head First Java*, 2E. Entertaining, visual, and very memorable, but long.
* Wampler, *The Essence of Object-Oriented Programming with Java* (2001). Old, but really good explanation of O-O concepts.
* *Starting Out with Java*, 5E by Tony Gaddis.  Covers the same material as *Big Java* but more focused presentation. Also covers JavaFX.
* David Eck, *Introduction to Programming in Java* free online and downloadable PDF at [http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/).  Good but too long, in my opinion.  Prof. Eck has other free books you may like.
* Horstmann, *Object-Oriented Design and Patterns*, 2E (2006). Condensed from "Big Java" with more emphasis on OO concepts and design.  Many SKE graduates say this is the **best book**.  OOP students can borrow my copy.
